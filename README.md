##What it has at the moment
	
	1. Symbol class 
		
		```
		instance of this class had his priority number and character
		```
	
	2. Stack class 
		
		```
		this is a Stack of Symbol and had a bases functionality like returning string of symbols in ONP system when pusshing new instance
		```
	
	3. Test class
		
		```
		this class themselves to diagnose the correctness of action Stack by pushing into a preapered string of math symbols and checking it with a prepered ONP version of this
